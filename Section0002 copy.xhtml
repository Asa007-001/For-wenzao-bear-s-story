    		<p>Wenzao Bear is not just an adorable mascot—it also embodies the spirit of public service and campus culture at Wenzao Ursuline University of Languages.</p>
			<p>This edition of Wenzao Bear was originally launched as a charity sale item, with proceeds supporting initiatives such as the "Disadvantaged Student Assistance Program" and the "Overseas Education Fund." It symbolizes the core spirit of Wenzao students—their willingness to serve.</p>
			<p>During events such as the school anniversary and alumni homecoming, Wenzao Bear is often presented by the university as a special gift to returning alumni.

		<blockquote>
    		<p>On Wenzao's campus, a small legend about “service and warmth” has been passed down.</p>
			<p>Many years ago, a little bear was born in the camphor forest behind the campus.</p>
			<p>It has a pair of soft paws and always enjoys helping others.</p>
			<p>Whether it's picking up handouts blown away by the wind,</p>
			<p>Or gently helping up a classmate who has fallen,</p>
			<p>The little bear always smiles and says, “I will serve!”</p>
			<p>One day, the little bear met an alumnus visiting their alma mater in the library—</p>
			<p>The alumnus was once a student in the German Department and had a passion for design.</p>
			<p>He was deeply moved by the little bear's kindness and decided to capture its image in a drawing.</p>
			<p>And turned it into an adorable bear plushie dressed in the Wenzao school uniform.</p>
			<p>He embroidered “Serviam” on the bear's sleeve—a Latin word meaning “I will serve.”</p>
			<p>From that day on, the bear was affectionately known as “Wenzao Bear.”</p>
			<p>It embodies the spirit of Wenzao students:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Willing to help others</b></li>
				<li><b>Embracing diversity</b></li>
				<li><b>Spreading warmth through a smile</b></li>
			</ol>
	
			<p>Today, when you see Wenzao Bear around campus,</p>
			<p>Perhaps it's gently reminding you—</p>
			<p>“Service is not an obligation, but a kind of happiness.”</p>
